# arcd

Simple arithmetic coding library. It produces the same output you will expect from production quality library, however it doesn't have fancy performance optimizations, so expect it to be slower. The main purpose of this library is research and experimentation. Benefits:
* Written in C
* Simple API
* Easy to understand implementation
* Easy to experiment with

Key goals:
* Allow to be used everywhere (minumal dependencies, C)
* Simple to integrate (simple and straightforward API)
* Easy to experiment with (simple implementation)
